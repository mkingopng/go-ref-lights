What’s Left To Do

1. Health Check Mechanism
	- Many meets require a “ready” status only if all three referees are logged in correctly.
	- Implementing a real “health check” might involve verifying that left/centre/right have valid connections, then blocking lifts or showing a warning if one is missing.

2. Referee Position Control
	- You have a simpler “position claim” flow, but you may want more robust logic for switching positions mid-meet (e.g., an admin or meet director interface so referees can only move in one official place, not from the front-end alone).

3. Multiple Meets / Scalability
	- Right now, you have a single global set of timers and referee sessions.
	- Supporting multiple parallel meets (e.g. Meet A and Meet B at the same time) would require scoping timers and positions by meet ID.

4. Detailed Logging & Centralized Monitoring
	- Although you have console logs, you may want more structured logs or a centralized logging service (e.g., CloudWatch, ELK stack, etc.).
	- This helps track specific meets, user sessions, and quickly diagnose issues in production.

5. User Instructions & Docs
	- You might document steps for referees to sign in, claim a position, interpret lights, and handle edge cases.
	- A simple “How-To” for meet directors can reduce confusion and training overhead.

6. Auto-Reset Decisions After 15s
	- Currently, your final results display for 30 seconds (configurable) in `broadcastFinalResults`.
	- If you specifically want a 15-second auto-clear, just tweak `resultsDisplayDuration` or add logic to clear earlier.

7. UI Tweaks
	- Increase green dot size, set text messages to linger for exactly 15 seconds, etc.
	- These quick visual adjustments can be handled in your CSS / JavaScript.

### **Recommended Next Step**

A common immediate next step is **implementing a “health check”**:
1. If all three refs (left, center, right) aren’t properly connected, show a warning or prevent “Platform Ready” from starting.
2. Possibly add an endpoint or a small UI indicator that shows “3/3 referees connected.”

After that, you might move on to **refining your position-switching flow** or **scaling for multiple meets** if that’s high priority for your upcoming events.
